# Mise Handoff Log

**Purpose:** Session-by-session implementation notes. Each development session appends a new entry with details of what was done, what was tested, and what's next.

**Last Updated:** January 13, 2026
**Current Phase:** Phase 6 - The Recipe Card
**Current Branch:** feat/phase-5-cookbook-view (pending merge)
**Version:** 0.1.0

---

## 📋 How This Document Works

This log serves as the **detailed implementation journal** for the Mise project. While `Feature Roadmap.md` tracks *what* gets built (high-level phases and tasks), this document tracks *how* each session progresses.

### Entry Structure
Each session should include:
1. **Date and Phase** — When and what we worked on
2. **Session Summary** — One paragraph overview
3. **What Was Done** — Specific files created/modified
4. **What Was Tested** — Verification steps and results
5. **Issues Discovered** — Bugs, edge cases, or concerns
6. **Next Session Prompt** — Specific starting point for continuity

### Important Notes
- **Append only** — Don't edit previous sessions (except typo fixes)
- **Be specific** — Reference file paths, function names, and line numbers
- **Test results are mandatory** — Every session must document testing
- **Suggest commits** — Include recommended commit message at session end

## Session: January 13, 2026 - Project Inception & Documentation

### Phase
Phase 0: Documentation & Planning

### Session Summary
Initial planning session for "Mise," a culinary operating system for Obsidian. Conducted extensive discovery interview with the project manager to clarify requirements across all features. Created comprehensive documentation including a detailed Feature Roadmap, enriched Project Summary, and updated AI instructions. Established the modular architecture pattern and development workflow protocol.

### What Was Done

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Discovery Interview | 32 questions answered covering user context, meal planning, shopping lists, UI preferences, and priorities |
| Feature Roadmap | Created `Feature Roadmap.md` with 18 phases, data structures, task checklists, and ideas parking lot |
| Project Summary | Rewrote `Project Summary.md` with full vision, design principles, and architecture overview |
| CLAUDE.md | Updated with mandatory development workflow, anti-patterns, and documentation index |
| Handoff Log | Restructured this file to clarify its purpose and entry format |
| UI Mockup | Generated Quick Look modal mockup image for recipe preview feature |

### Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Architecture | Modular services + parsers | Avoid monolithic main.ts, easier testing |
| Meal Plan Structure | Monthly files with 3 tables (B/L/D) | Cleaner for parsing and drag-drop |
| Time Format | Integer minutes in frontmatter | Enables sorting/filtering, smart display |
| Shopping Lists | New file per generation | Historical record, no data loss |
| No MVP Language | Banned from docs | Personal project, infinite runway |
| Nutritional Data | Define structure now, populate later | Avoid painful migration later |
| Quick Look | Modal (not hover) | Mobile-friendly, consistent UX |

### What Was Tested
- N/A (documentation-only session, no code to test)

### Issues Discovered
- None (planning phase)

### Files Modified
- `docs/Feature Roadmap.md` — Created (new file)
- `docs/Project Summary.md` — Rewritten
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` — Updated with workflow
- `docs/Handoff Log.md` — Restructured
- `docs/Implementation Planning.md` — Retained as reference (superseded by Feature Roadmap)

## Session: January 13, 2026 - Foundation & Configuration

### Phase
Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration

### Session Summary
Scaffolded the entire plugin project structure including TypeScript configuration, esbuild build system, and modular architecture. Created comprehensive type definitions for all data structures (Recipe, MealPlan, ShoppingList, Settings). Implemented full settings tab with folder autocomplete using Obsidian's `AbstractInputSuggest`. Added auto-archive dropdown setting. Deployed and verified plugin loads correctly.

### What Was Done

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| npm project setup | TypeScript + esbuild, all dependencies configured |
| Modular folder structure | `src/types/`, `services/`, `parsers/`, `ui/`, `utils/` |
| Type definitions | Complete interfaces for Recipe, MealPlan, ShoppingList, MiseSettings |
| Settings tab | `MiseSettingsTab` with folder autocomplete, auto-archive dropdown |
| FolderSuggest component | Custom autocomplete using `AbstractInputSuggest` |
| Placeholder services | RecipeIndexer, MealPlanService, ShoppingListService |
| Parsers | IngredientParser, FrontmatterParser with time/rating/category helpers |
| Build config | `esbuild.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, `manifest.json` |

### What Was Tested
- [x] Plugin builds without errors
- [x] Plugin loads in Obsidian
- [x] Settings tab displays correctly
- [x] Folder autocomplete works
- [x] Auto-archive dropdown shows options
- [x] Settings persist across restarts

### Issues Discovered
- Initial import paths for nested UI components needed fixing (`../types` → `../../types`)
- `TFolder` import needed for folder autocomplete TypeScript compatibility

### Files Created
- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `esbuild.config.mjs`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`
- `src/main.ts`, `src/types/index.ts`
- `src/services/RecipeIndexer.ts`, `MealPlanService.ts`, `ShoppingListService.ts`, `index.ts`
- `src/parsers/IngredientParser.ts`, `FrontmatterParser.ts`, `index.ts`
- `src/ui/settings/MiseSettingsTab.ts`, `src/ui/components/FolderSuggest.ts`
- `src/utils/constants.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `index.ts`

## Session: January 13, 2026 - The Silent Indexer

### Phase
Phase 2: The Silent Indexer

### Session Summary
Implemented real-time recipe indexing to replace the external Python script. Created `RecipeIndexer` service with vault scanning, event hooks for file changes, and metadataCache integration for fast frontmatter access. Fixed timing issues by using `workspace.onLayoutReady`. Added DEBUG flag to control console verbosity. All CRUD operations tested and verified working.

### What Was Done

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| RecipeIndexer core | Complete implementation with ~350 lines |
| Vault scanning | Recursive folder scan with `getMarkdownFilesRecursive()` |
| Event hooks | create, modify, delete, rename - all wired up |
| Debouncing | 300ms debounce on modify events |
| metadataCache | Uses cache for frontmatter parsing |
| Recipe building | Extracts title, category, rating, times, ingredients, etc. |
| Search/filter methods | `search()`, `filterByCategory()`, `filterByDietaryFlag()` |
| Timing fix | Moved initialization to `workspace.onLayoutReady` |
| Console cleanup | Added DEBUG flag, reduced verbosity |

### What Was Tested
- [x] Initial scan indexes all recipes in folder
- [x] Create new file → triggers indexing
- [x] Modify file → triggers update (debounced)
- [x] Delete file → removes from index
- [x] Rename file → updates path correctly
- [x] Console output clean (only startup message)

### Issues Discovered & Fixed
- **Timing issue**: Indexer was running before vault was fully loaded, resulting in 0 recipes and then "Recipe created" spam as files loaded. Fixed by using `workspace.onLayoutReady`.
- **Console spam**: "Recipe created" logged for every file on reload. Fixed by only emitting events after `isInitialized = true`.

### Files Modified
- `src/services/RecipeIndexer.ts` — Complete rewrite with full implementation
- `src/main.ts` — Used `onLayoutReady` for indexer initialization

## Session: January 13, 2026 - The Ingredient Parser

### Phase
Phase 3: The Ingredient Parser

### Session Summary
Enhanced the IngredientParser with robust header detection supporting multiple patterns (emoji variations, case-insensitive). Added quantity parsing for future recipe scaling, and ingredient normalization for future shopping list deduplication.

### What Was Done

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Header detection | Multiple regex patterns for `## Ingredients` variations |
| Section extraction | Finds content between header and next ## or HR |
| Line cleaning | Removes bullets, checkboxes, numbered lists |
| Sub-header detection | Skips `**Bold**` style sub-headers |
| Quantity parsing | New `parseIngredientQuantity()` extracts qty/unit/ingredient |
| Normalization | New `normalizeIngredient()` for deduplication |

### What Was Tested
- [x] Plugin builds without errors
- [x] Plugin loads and indexes all recipes
- [x] Ingredients parsed correctly from example files

### Issues Discovered
- None

### Files Modified
- `src/parsers/IngredientParser.ts` — Complete rewrite with enhanced features
- `src/parsers/index.ts` — Added new exports

---

## Session: January 13, 2026 - Time Format Migration

### Phase
Phase 4: Time Format Migration

### Session Summary
Created `TimeMigrationService` to convert all time strings in recipe frontmatter to normalized integer minutes. Added preview and migrate commands. User ran migration successfully, converting all recipes to integer format.

### What Was Done

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| TimeMigrationService | New service with `migrateAll()` and `previewMigration()` |
| Preview command | Shows what would change without modifying files |
| Migrate command | Updates files and re-indexes |
| parseTime() | Already existed, handles many formats |
| formatTime() | Already existed, converts back to human-readable |

### What Was Tested
- [x] Preview shows correct changes
- [x] Migration updates all recipe files
- [x] Re-indexing works after migration

### Issues Discovered
- None

### Files Created
- `src/services/TimeMigrationService.ts` — Migration utility

### Files Modified
- `src/services/index.ts` — Added TimeMigrationService export
- `src/main.ts` — Added migration commands
